1. Interface fixes:

   1) Get the sound back in (user optional)
   2) Have the CA compute and display out to the number of steps ahead
      that are visible,
   3) Recompute out to the edge of visibility whenever a human switches
      a cells value.
   4) Need better ways of interacting once the interaction area is in
      motion. Example: not possible to draw a horizontal line.
   5) Currently, reset does not do the right thing
   6) It would be nice to have a "step" button
   7) We should work on the overall UI design/layout. I am finding it
      very awkward attempting to use this on a tablet (eg, buttons are
      too small, too close together, etc)
   8) "On" and "off" toggle buttons tend to be confusing unless it is
      clear whether they are indicating a) current state, or b) the
      action to take. My suggestion is to change the text as follows:
      "Turn sound [off/on]"
   9) Do we still need a toggle for live interaction?
   10) We need to be able to scale the grid smaller/larger.
   11) How did we loose the nice clean attack and decay?
   12) You might want to set the Gain to the sound model a little lower
       since when so many notes are played at the same time, they distort.
   13) Do the words on the button indicate the current state, or the
       state that the system would be in if the button were pushed. Can
       you fix this classical interface issue?
   14) FIXED: It would be great to control the rate (the time step) so
       one can see better what is happening if one wants.

2. Testing the CA rules/replicating results:

   1) rule 148: (to test)

      A random configuration I used sent the system into a period-3
      loop - already interesting musically. Actually, some cells were
      period 3, others constant. But with my (blind) input, I good get
      the pattern to change. First I found different period 3 patterns
      were triggered by my intervention. Then something I did caused it
      to go into a period-4 loop. All without stopping/restarting the
      sequence.

      The looping pattern of things guys *might* be less studied than
      other aspects. However, it is a fundamental issue for musical
      applications.  I can find behavior that has extremely long
      periods, and behavior that is period once you factor out a spacial
      shift (transposition in musical terms).

   2) Rule 133:

      One of the the things that came up in the last discussion about
      replicating Varela's results was that he had constructed the image on
      page 157, using different diagrams. So, I started testing the
      different local patterns in the diagram and found one result that
      matches that even change recognition rule.

   3) Identifying the Wolfram and Varela rule numbers?

3. Browser compatibilities:

   - I have now tested on a new/clean install of Debian. It works in
     Chromium, but not in Iceweasel. Please download and test your code
     on Iceweasel. It should work if it works on Firefox, so not sure
     what is happening.

4. Further discussions:

   All of us need to have a discussion about music when you come
   back. In particular, although I can see what Lonce finds exciting and
   compelling about this interaction, it is not clear to me that we are
   going to find anything distinctive about rules/perturbations that
   "result in signification" as compared to any of the other
   rules/perturbations. So, although I can see how this is interesting
   for Lonce in terms of anticipatory scores/interaction, it is not
   clear (yet) how rich it is in terms of showing the potential of
   autopoietic co-improv.

   I agree with Kevin on this point. I had an idea about connecting
   Bittorio, music and rule signification, in a way that is intuitive to
   me. I will highlight my current thought on it in a separate mail
   thread.

   I think, there are two parts to the rule signification with regards
   to music: 1) aural distinctions, 2)

   - CA behaviors are aurally distinguished.

     With bittorio, Varela made a visual distinction, between 2 rules
     that result in odd and even sequence recognition. With musical CA,
     the distinctions between 2 rules have to be aurally distinguished.
     For example, one rule plays music of the same duration in every
     time step, another rule increases or decreases the duration of
     music produced in a time step, another rule first increases the
     duration and then decreases the duration of music produced in each
     time step. [This is a different model of CA-sound mapping from the
     pentatonic mapping, and I will try to spell my arguments for the
     same]

   - Mapping to rhythm:

     There are many ways of mapping the CA to music.  Right now, each CA
     cell is mapped to a *different* note in a pentatonic scale.

     It somehow results in too many things happening musically that
     makes it hard to study how the signification happens.

     I would propose a different integration between each cell of the CA
     and music. Each color of the CA cell is mapped on to one of two
     note durations, namely, a half note (Black) and a quarter note
     (white). For example, an array of 4 CA cells can have a maximum and
     minimum duration of 8 beats and 4 beats.

     There are some overall behaviors that a listener can observe from
     the CA, such as, does the CA maintain a constant duration, does it
     show perioidic varaitions of the same duration, under what
     conditions does it increase the duration from 4 to 6, under what
     conditions does it decrease from 6 to 4 etc.

     I believe this is what Lonce is saying with a period-3 loop -
     already interesting musically. Actually, some cells were period 3,
     others constant. But with my (blind) input, I good get the pattern
     to change.

     Changes to the state of the

     Changes to the state of the CA are then changes to the rhythm
     patterns.

     the core thing about what the CA does from the interaction , I'm
     not sure how the cell

     There are a three questions that seem worth experimenting with CA
     systems designed for user interaction:
     - What are the CA rules that can result in stable (fixed, periodic)
       behavior. Answer: type1, type2 rules.
     - Given that there are CA rules could potentially exhibit stable
       behavior, what are the different perturbations that the user can
       create that lead to this stable/periodic behavior.
     - How would we (as users) describe the "signification" brought
       forth by the system as a result of this interaction.

     With bittorio, Varela makes a visual distinction between 2 rules
     that result in odd and even sequence recognition. With musical CA,
     I think, the distinctions between rules have to be aural.
     Personally, I think, things will be easier if I am able to (for a
     start) listen for and distinguish these musical changes created by
     the CA. And, the most intuitive way (I think) I could do this, is
     to map the CA to rhythm hits of different durations.

     In the following paragraphs, I will try to spell out an interaction
     model, which I think, is a different from what Lonce has proposed.

     In this model, every color of a CA cell is mapped to a rhythm hit
     of a certain duration. Black cells are mapped to hits of half note
     duratipn and white cells mapped to hits of quarter note
     duration. At every time step, all cells are played in a sequence
     from left to right at some fixed tempo. Thus, every CA
     configuration is a rhythm sequence containing half-notes and
     quarter notes with an overall duration between 4 (all quarter
     notes) and 8 beats (all half notes). And at every time step, this
     configuration is played and listened by the user.

     Pertubations (input):

     In this model, perturbations to the system occur in the same way as
     before. The system is structurally coupled with the future cells
     and the state of the immediate future cell replaces the state of
     the current cell.

     For the user, there is crucial difference in the interaction. For
     the user, the perturbations are no longer viewed as a isolated
     single clicks but as an entire array of cells.

     However, in this model, each array of cells (with black and white
     sequences) is as a rhythm pattern.  So, in the perspective of the
     user, the *input* that he gives to the system is a rhythm pattern
     of a certain sequence (half and quarter hits) and duration. The
     *output* given by the system is another rhythm of a certain
     sequence (half and quarter hits) and duration.

     Within this space, there are some overall behaviors that a listener
     can observe from the CA such as: 1) under what perturbations does
     CA repeat his sequence, 2) under what perturbations does the CA
     maintain a constant duration of beats, 3) under what perturbations
     does CA increase the duration from 4 beats to 6 (or 7,8), under
     what perturbations does it decrease duration from 4 beats to 3
     (2,1) etc.

     From this setup, a worthwhile result would be to find some
     qualitative co-improv behaviors during interaction with the CA
     rules/perturbations such as - input imitation (CA repates users
     input rhythm), speeding up (from half-notes to quarter notes),
     progressive sequences (from 4 beats to 5,6,7).

     I believe, with this setup, it would a touch easier to begin
     describing, in musical terms, the signification that system brings
     forth out of the interaction with the user.



     Then, broadly terms of a co-improv question, what rhythmic changes
     does the CA respond to?
     - Can we have an imitation CA?
     - CAn we have an analogy CA?
     - CAn we have an Arrpegiating CA?
     - Can we have an concatenating CA?


     I believe this is a different interaction model from what Lonce has
     proposed.

     saying with a period-3 loop - already interesting
     musically. Actually, some cells were period 3, others constant. But
     with my (blind) input, I good get the pattern to change.

     a CA rule plays music of the same duration in every time step,
     another rule increases or decreases the duration of music produced
     in a time step, another rule first increases the duration and then
     decreases the duration of music produced in each time step. [This
     is a different model of CA-sound mapping from the pentatonic
     mapping, and I will try to spell my arguments for the same]

     There are also two models of sound production that we have
     described, and one of them seems closer to the autopoietic model.


     There are other reasons for proposing this change:

     - The representation of the CA that we have used so far, resembles
       the box notation representation for rhythm (attached in the
       diagram)
     - User's actions (clicking of cells) actually represent a rhythmic
       sequence that the user plays.
     -

     Rule signification happens thus: From the human side, humans are
     able to interact and characterize the output as a certain musical
     behaviors (eg, CA produces rhythms of same duration for four beat
     rhythms).

     I'm basically saying that, black and white are now, hits of quarter
     note and half note duration. So, any kind of seqeuencing of the CA
     is a rhythm pattern.

     Certain kinds of input are going to make the CA change its
     configuration and thus the CA distinguishes certain changes from
     other changes. These changes are interms of changes to the duration
     of an input rhythm.

     In other words, I'm trying to see, what is the musical change that
     someone can make and what musical change can they expect to hear in
     the CA. And, how does the mapping help to impact this change.

     Changes to the spatial configuration of the CA are changes that are
     signigficant to the CA.

     User has a sense of the changes he is making, ad

     Then, in terms of a co-improv question, what rhythmic changes does
     the CA respond to?
     - Can we have an imitation CA?
     - CAn we have an analogy CA?
     - CAn we have an Arrpegiating CA?
     - Can we have an concatenating CA?

   In terms of transformations in interaction that can be done to the
   objects on the screen, I have some reference apps, that provide
   different kinds of interactions.
